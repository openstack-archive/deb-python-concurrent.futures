python-concurrent.futures (2.1.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Adopting the package (Closes: #736714).
  * Moves the package to pkg-openstack because I want to use Git.
  * Added missing build-depends: python-unittest2.
  * Removes Provides: python-futures, since concurrent.futures is really the
    new API that upstream wants to advertise for.
  * Added extend-diff-ignore = "^[^/]*[.]egg-info/" in debian/source/options,
    and removed the rm -rf *.egg-info from debian/rules.

python-concurrent.futures (2.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Fixes the fact that the package isn't installed at all in /usr/lib/python,
    which makes it completely unusable:
    - Added missing --with python2.
    - Added explicit --buildsystem=python_distutils.
    - Added Provides: python-futures
    - Added missing ${sphinxdoc:Depends}, installing correctly with sphinx-build
  * Removed useless XS-Python-Version: >= 2.6.
  * Removed deprecated python-support build-depends in the favor of dh_python2,
    and therefore now build-depends on python-all version (>= 2.6.6-3~).
  * Ran wrap-and-sort.
  * Fixed Format field of debian/copyright.
